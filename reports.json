    "gemini": "# Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery\n\n**Policies**:\nThis text outlines several key policies within the Zeno Group:\n\n* **Whistleblowing Policy:**  Establishes a framework and system for reporting compliance violations, including violations of laws, the Zeno Code of Conduct, and other guidelines and policies. It emphasizes data protection, security, and confidentiality throughout the reporting process.  The policy applies to all companies in which Zeno has a majority stake or manages.\n* **Anti-Corruption Policy:**  Details Zeno's zero-tolerance stance on corruption, including bribery, conflicts of interest, gifts, loans, sponsoring, funding, lobbying, and business relationships.  It outlines countermeasures like a whistleblowing system and training, as well as consequences for violations.  The policy emphasizes transparency and making business decisions in the company's best interest, free from personal influence.\n* **Compliance Policy (mentioned within Business Policy):**  Referenced as part of a broader anti-fraud management system, addressing corruption risks and detection.  It's linked to a checklist covering various areas like corporate governance, third-party interactions, memberships, financial interests, donations, employee regulations, and rules for interactions with customers, competitors, suppliers, and other business partners.  This suggests a comprehensive approach to compliance beyond anti-corruption.\n* **Code of Conduct (and Zeno Code):**  Referred to as a standard against which violations are measured within the Whistleblowing Policy. It likely sets general ethical expectations for employee behavior.\n\n\nThe policies aim to prevent corrupt practices, provide reporting mechanisms, and ensure compliance with laws and internal standards.  They apply broadly across the Zeno Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n\n**Training**:\nThere is no text provided to summarize, therefore no summary regarding training can be created.  The input consists entirely of whitespace and parentheses.\n\n\n**Whistleblowing Mechanisms**:\nZeno provides a confidential whistleblowing system accessible to employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders to report Code of Conduct violations without fear of retaliation.  The system supports anonymous reporting and guarantees thorough investigation and follow-up.  Internally, reports can be made to line managers, the Whistleblowing Officer, or management.  The system defines specific roles and access rights, detailed in \"Appendix 1 \u2013 Whistleblowing System \u2013 Roles and Rights.\"  These roles include Administrator (technical administration), Report Recipient (assigns cases), Case Manager (handles cases), and designated employees with read-only or temporary case handling access.  The system enforces the four-eyes principle for case closure and deletion by the Whistleblowing Team.\n\n\n**Due Diligence**:\nZeno requires suppliers to comply with their standards, including ethical business conduct, environmental responsibility, and supply chain responsibility.  Due diligence is specifically mentioned regarding the supply chain, requiring *diligent monitoring and verification* of supplier and subcontractor adherence to Zeno's standards.  Failure to comply may result in contract termination.  While the provided text details aspects of internal due diligence processes (audits, knowledge requirements for auditors), it primarily emphasizes the expectation of due diligence from suppliers in upholding Zeno's standards.\n\n\n**Legal Cases**:\nThis text outlines policies related to legal cases primarily through preventative measures aimed at compliance with various laws and regulations.  While no specific legal cases are mentioned, the text emphasizes compliance in areas that could lead to legal action if violated.  These areas include:\n\n* **Fair competition:**  The text prohibits price-fixing agreements, mandates review of agreements with potential anti-competitive effects, and generally forbids practices that restrict competition or manipulate markets.  These stipulations aim to prevent antitrust lawsuits and regulatory investigations.\n* **Labor and human rights:**  The focus on preventing illegal work, ensuring proper work permits for foreign workers, and complying with local labor laws aims to avoid legal challenges related to labor exploitation and immigration violations.\n* **Corruption:**  The text prohibits \"facilitation payments\" to public officials or employees of other companies, mandates training on corruption-related topics, and requires due diligence and appropriate compensation for agents and representatives. These measures aim to prevent bribery and corruption charges.\n* **Intellectual property:**  The policy asserts ownership of intellectual property created during employment and emphasizes respect for intellectual property rights, seeking to avoid copyright and patent infringement lawsuits.\n* **Fraud:**  The company's strict policy against fraud and deception, including misrepresentation and falsification of records, aims to prevent legal action related to fraudulent activities.\n\nThe emphasis on compliance, training, approvals, and reviews throughout the text demonstrates a proactive approach to minimizing the risk of legal cases.\n\n\n**Sanctions**:\nZeno Consult's policy outlines sanctions for corruption and anti-competitive practices.  For corruption, consequences for Zeno include fines, sanctions, criminal proceedings, financial losses, reputational damage, operational disruption, and loss of business.  Suppliers violating ethical standards may face contract termination.  While the document doesn't explicitly state sanctions for anti-competitive behavior, it emphasizes regular audits and evaluations to identify and address potential violations, suggesting that corrective actions and potential penalties would follow.\n\n\n# Ethical Business Practices\n\n**Code Of Conduct**:\nZeno's Code of Conduct outlines the company's commitment to human rights, ethical behavior, environmental responsibility, and strong governance.  It applies to all Zeno companies and is based on international standards and national laws, including the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act.  The Code prohibits forced and child labor, discrimination, and promotes fair working conditions, wages, and occupational safety.  It addresses fair business practices, including anti-corruption, fair competition, intellectual property protection, conflict of interest management, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, and data protection.  The Code also covers gifts and donations, export controls, and supply chain management.  Zeno monitors compliance through training, guidance from compliance officers, and a confidential whistleblowing system.  Consequences for violations can include disciplinary action and termination of employment or business relationships.  The Code is regularly reviewed and updated to maintain relevance and effectiveness.\n\n\n**Compliance System**:\nThe compliance system described across these documents emphasizes several key components:\n\n* **Code of Conduct and Policies:**  Written business principles, codes of conduct, and specific policies addressing corruption and anti-competitive practices are in place and binding for employees and business partners.  These policies cover areas such as conflicts of interest, gifts and entertainment, and antitrust compliance.\n* **Whistleblowing System:**  A confidential whistleblowing system is available for reporting suspected violations of company policies, competition laws, or instances of corruption.  This system is managed by a designated Whistleblowing Officer.\n* **Internal Control System (ICS):**  An ICS is implemented with independent audit functions (internal audit, compliance) conducting regular reviews across all company areas, subsidiaries, and IT systems.  This system is designed to detect corruption and other compliance violations.  A standardized process exists for handling initial indications or evidence of corruption (Anti-Fraud Management).  Corruption cases are analyzed, and control measures are developed and implemented to minimize future risks.\n* **Auditing and Monitoring:**  Regular audits and evaluations of business practices, agreements, and market conduct are performed to identify and address potential competition law violations.  Zeno reserves the right to audit business partners' compliance with the Business Partner Code of Conduct, either directly or through third-party auditors.  Business partners are also expected to monitor and report on their own compliance.\n* **Training and Communication:**  Compliance policies and procedures are communicated to all management and employees, and are subject to periodic review.  Annual evaluations of awareness and compliance with these guidelines are conducted.\n* **Record Keeping:**  Records related to compliance activities, including training, investigations, and audits, are maintained and made available for review by compliance officers, external auditors, or regulatory authorities.\n* **Business Partner Compliance:**  Zeno extends its compliance requirements to its business partners, mandating adherence to ethical standards, implementation of whistleblowing systems, compliance monitoring and reporting, and requiring compliance from their own suppliers and subcontractors.  Breaches of these standards can lead to termination of the business agreement.\n\n\n**Ethical Decision-Making**:\nThis text outlines ethical decision-making primarily through the lens of compliance.  It emphasizes several key areas:\n\n* **Transparency and integrity:**  All business dealings should be conducted openly and honestly, avoiding corruption, bribery, fraud, and conflicts of interest.  This includes responsible lobbying practices and transparent sponsorship/funding activities.\n* **Accountability:** A whistleblowing mechanism allows for anonymous reporting of unethical conduct, and the organization commits to monitoring compliance and providing documentation.\n* **Responsibility across the supply chain:**  The standards extend to suppliers and subcontractors, with potential contract termination for significant violations.\n* **Specific examples of unethical conduct:** The text provides concrete examples of unacceptable behavior, such as accepting inappropriate gifts, engaging in money laundering or fraud, misusing information, and showing favoritism.  It also highlights \u201calarm signals\u201d like unusual payment flows and unexplained accounting discrepancies that could indicate unethical behavior.\n* **Environmental and social responsibility:** While not solely focused on ethics, the text touches on environmental responsibility and providing a safe working environment, suggesting these are also considered part of ethical operations.\n\nIn essence, the text promotes a culture of ethical decision-making by defining unacceptable behaviors, providing reporting mechanisms, and emphasizing accountability throughout the organization and its supply chain.\n\n\n**Non-Compliance Incidents**:\nNon-compliance incidents related to corruption are a key focus of this policy.  Such incidents can be identified through various \"red flags\" including unusual payment flows, missing documentation, sudden lifestyle changes in employees, unusual decision-making, lack of transparency, conflicts of interest, excessive gifts or hospitality, deviations from market conditions, unexpected third-party involvement in contracts, and resistance to anti-bribery clauses by business partners.  These incidents can be reported through a whistleblowing system available to employees, customers, partners, and third parties, either anonymously or with contact details.  Consequences of non-compliance for Zeno Consult include legal action, financial losses, reputational damage, operational disruption, and loss of business.  For suppliers, significant violations can lead to contract termination.\n\n\n# Lobbying and Political Contributions\n\n**Lobbying Activities**:\nLobbying involves influencing political decision-makers and public opinion.  Transparency is crucial concerning the parties involved, the lobbying objectives, and the methods employed.  All lobbying activities must comply with legal and ethical standards.\n\n\n**Political Contributions**:\nThis text does not directly address political contributions in the traditional sense of donations to political campaigns or parties.  However, it does discuss activities that can have political implications and potentially be used to gain improper political influence:\n\n* **Lobbying:** The text emphasizes transparency in lobbying efforts, including disclosing involved parties, objectives, and methods.  It stresses adherence to legal and ethical standards, implying that lobbying activities can be misused for corrupt purposes.\n\n* **Sponsoring and Funding:**  While acknowledging the legitimate role of sponsoring and funding for marketing and social responsibility, the text warns against using these activities to secure inappropriate benefits or favoritism. This suggests that sponsoring and funding could be used as a veiled form of political contribution to gain influence.\n\n* **Gifts and Invitations:** The text cautions against using gifts and invitations to unduly influence business decisions, highlighting the potential for these seemingly innocuous practices to be a form of corruption.  In a political context, this could extend to influencing political decision-makers.\n\n* **Bribery:** The broad definition of bribery provided in the text, encompassing offering, giving, promising, soliciting, etc., anything of value to influence a decision or action, could encompass actions aimed at gaining political favor.\n\nIn summary, the text doesn't explicitly mention political contributions as donations, but it highlights related activities like lobbying, sponsoring, gifting, and bribery, warning against their misuse for improper influence, which could include gaining political advantage.\n\n\n**Transparency**:\nZeno's transparency policy focuses on keeping shareholders informed.  The company commits to providing shareholders with regular updates, including annual reports and financial information throughout the year, as well as prompt notification of any major developments.  While not directly related to shareholder transparency, the whistleblowing policy emphasizes confidentiality and allows anonymous reporting, promoting transparency in internal control and compliance processes.\n\n\n**Governance Oversight**:\nThis Corporate Governance Code outlines the governance oversight of Zeno, based on international and national standards.  Oversight is primarily executed through the Management Board and Supervisory Board, who are jointly committed to protecting shareholder and company interests.  The Supervisory Board's responsibilities include overseeing the Management Board, as detailed in sections 5.1 and 5.2, which cover their tasks, responsibilities, and the specific role of the Chairman.  The code details the election and remuneration of the Supervisory Board (5.3, 5.4) and addresses potential conflicts of interest (5.5). The Management Board's duties and structure are outlined in Section 4, covering responsibilities (4.1), structure and remuneration (4.2), and conflicts of interest (4.3).  The Annual General Meeting, where the Management Board presents financial statements and reports, serves as a key forum for shareholder engagement and oversight (Section 2.2).  Finally, the code emphasizes transparency (Section 6) and outlines accounting and auditing procedures (Section 7) as further mechanisms of governance control.  A whistleblowing system, detailed in Appendix 1, provides an additional channel for oversight and accountability.\n\n\n# Additional Governance Disclosures\n\n**Alignment With Standards**:\nBusiness partners must align their practices with recognized business standards and keep them up-to-date.  Suppliers must also comply with these standards, which are aligned with Zeno's ethical, social, and environmental values, and include legal and regulatory compliance, human rights and labor practices, and ethical business conduct.  Zeno reserves the right to audit compliance, and significant breaches may result in contract termination.  Suppliers acknowledge that violations may lead to contract termination.\n\n\n**Stakeholder Engagement**:\nZeno's stakeholder engagement strategy prioritizes building constructive relationships, fostering dialogue, and incorporating stakeholder perspectives into CSR decision-making.  They plan to achieve this through regular, transparent communication across various channels, enabling stakeholders to voice concerns, provide input, and collaborate on CSR initiatives.  Zeno commits to allocating sufficient resources, including personnel and budget, to support these engagement efforts.  Furthermore, the company will continuously monitor and evaluate these activities to ensure alignment with company objectives and identify areas for improvement.  Risk management is also integrated into the process, with Zeno proactively identifying and assessing potential risks associated with stakeholder engagement, such as miscommunication and unmet expectations.  Key stakeholders identified include the Board of Directors, CEO, employees, and the legal department, among others.\n\n\n**Performance Metrics**:\nThe provided text touches on performance metrics indirectly through a few key areas:\n\n* **Incentives and Compensation:** The text questions whether compensation structures are designed to avoid incentivizing unethical behavior, such as excessive performance bonuses. This implies a need to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of compensation structures in driving desired behaviors and avoiding unintended consequences.  While not explicitly mentioning performance metrics, it highlights the importance of aligning compensation with ethical conduct, suggesting that ethical behavior should be a factor in performance evaluation.\n\n* **Compliance System Effectiveness:** The text discusses the implementation and monitoring of a compliance system.  The effectiveness of this system would likely be measured through various performance metrics, though these are not specified.  The scoring system (2, 33, X) suggests a form of performance measurement related to implementation and monitoring of compliance processes.\n\n* **Financial Accounting and Controls:**  The numerous questions regarding financial processes (e.g., payment approvals, chart of accounts adherence, IT system security) imply a focus on controlling and monitoring financial performance. While specific metrics aren't mentioned, the emphasis on these controls suggests a need for performance measurement to ensure their effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, the text infers the importance of performance measurement related to ethical conduct, compliance system effectiveness, and financial controls. However, it does not explicitly define specific performance metrics used in these areas.\n\n\n**Assurance**:\nThe provided text discusses assurance primarily in the context of supplier compliance.  While the term \"assurance\" isn't explicitly used, the text outlines mechanisms intended to *provide* assurance to Zeno that the supplier will adhere to ethical, social, and environmental standards. This assurance is achieved through the supplier's declaration of compliance and Zeno's right to monitor and verify adherence to the declared standards.  The severity of potential consequences (contract termination) for non-compliance further incentivizes the supplier to uphold the standards, indirectly reinforcing the assurance of compliance.\n\n",
